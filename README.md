This is my First Data Analysis project. It's a univariate analysis where I aim to fit a regression model on Wide Receiver's Yards per Game as a function of NFL Combine statistics. 
I coded the project in an rmd file using R, and the necessary packages to have installed are: dplyr, ggplot2, gridExtra, stringr, tidyr.
